<h1 align = "center">Online Game With Python</h1>

This repository contains two Python projects: an Online Multiplayer Game and an Online Chat Application. Both projects showcase real-time functionality using Python, sockets, and additional frameworks. The game was developed during a 12-hour coding livestream, while the chat application was created in a live session to experiment with socket-based communication and Flask for the front end.
