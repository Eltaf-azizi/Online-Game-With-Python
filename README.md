<h1 align = "center">Online Game With Python</h1>

This repository contains two Python projects: an Online Multiplayer Game and an Online Chat Application. Both projects showcase real-time functionality using Python, sockets, and additional frameworks. The game was developed during a 12-hour coding livestream, while the chat application was created in a live session to experiment with socket-based communication and Flask for the front end.

## Online Multiplayer Game
### Overview
This project is a real-time multiplayer game created with Python and Pygame, allowing players to connect to a server and interact within the game environment. Built in a 12-hour live coding session, the goal was to create a fully functional game that users could join and play together.

### Features

 - Multiplayer gameplay using socket connections
 - Real-time interactions and smooth gameplay
 - Basic Pygame interface for user engagement
